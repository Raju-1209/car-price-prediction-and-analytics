# car-price-prediction-and-analytics
Built 5 machine learning models to analyze and predict car price, model success, sales trends, market segments, and advertising impact using real-world automotive data. Tools used include Python, scikit-learn, statsmodels, and Excel.

# 🚗 Predictive Analytics & Segmentation in the Automotive Industry

This project explores advanced ML techniques to predict and understand various aspects of car data: price prediction, model success, clustering, sales forecasting, and mixed-effect modeling.

## 🧠 Key Models Built:
1. **Random Forest Regression** – Predict car prices
2. **Logistic & Random Forest Classifier** – Predict model success
3. **KMeans Clustering** – Market segmentation
4. **ARIMA, Holt’s, Exp Smoothing** – Weekly car sales forecasting
5. **Mixed Effects Model** – Impact of price and advertising on sales

## 📊 Tools Used:
- Python: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `statsmodels`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- Jupyter Notebook
- Excel (raw data source)

## 🧰 Files:
- `Car_Assignment.xlsx`: Raw dataset
- `Rajkumar_car_predictive_model_project.ipynb`: ML model code
- `Rajkumar_car_predictive_model_presentation.pdf`: Final report & visualizations

## 📌 Summary:
This project reflects real-world automotive business problems and how ML models can help predict outcomes and segment data for business insights.
